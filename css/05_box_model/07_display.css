/* 
    We have another property known as display.
    The display property sets whether an element should be treated as a block or an inline element and the layout
    used for its children, such as flow layout, grid and flex.

    It can take the following values
    
    1. none
    2. block
    3. inline
    4. inline-block(power of both block and inline elements)
*/

/* 
    BLOCK ELEMENTS
    ==============
    
    1. Width and height are respected.
    2. Box breaks onto a new line.
    3. Padding, margin and border cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
    4. By default, they take the entire width of the parent i.e the box extends in the inline
        direction to fill available space in container.(unless styled otherwise)
    5. Examples are h1, p, div, header, section, article, footer, etc.
*/

/* 
    INLINE ELEMENTS
    ==============
    
    1. Width and height are NOT respected.
    2. Box does NOT break onto a new line.
    3. Vertical padding, margin and borders apply but do NOT cause other elements
        to move away from the box.
    4. Horizontal padding, margin and border will apply and cause other boxes to move away.
    5. Examples are span, a, img.
*/

/* 
    INLINE BLOCK ELEMENT(combination of block and inline element)
    =============================================================
