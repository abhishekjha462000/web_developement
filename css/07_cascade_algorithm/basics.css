/* 
    In order to see which rule will be applied, We need to learn the CSS 
    cascading algorithm.

    It is dependent on 4 parts:
    1. Importance
    2. Origin
    3. Specifity
    4. Position

    Each of these is a seperate tier and to see which rule will be applied at the end
    we need to travel down the cascade.

/* 
    !important
    ==========
    Rules which are marked by !important have the utmost priority
    and will override any existing style.
*/

/* 
    Origin
    ======
    On the basis of origin, a CSS rule can come from 3 diff places.
    1. developer
    2. user
    3. browser

    The rules written by the developer has the utmost priority and will overwrite any similar property
    written by the browser's default stylesheet.

    For example:
    The browser sets the default color of any text to black but even a simple universal selector 
    written by the user will change the color of all the text elements in the browser.

    * {
        color : purple;
    }
