/* 
    1 rem represents the font-size of the root element (typically <html>). When used within the root element font-size,
    it represents its initial value. A common browser default is 16px, but user-defined preferences may modify this.

    We as user can also change this by going into the settings and modifying it.

    If the root element's font-size is 20px, then 1 rem is always 20px and 2 rem is always 40px.
