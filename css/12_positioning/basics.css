/* 
    We have another property in CSS which is called position.

    It can take only 5 values. These are
    1. relative
    2. sticky
    3. absolute
    4. static
    5. fixed

    By default the value of position is set to static.

    We also have 5 other complementary properties which work under the hood of position.
    These are
    1. top
    2. bottom
    3. left
    4. right
    5. z-index

    By default, the position is set to static and thus these properties do not work as well.
    We need to set position property to some non-static value in order to make these properties
    work.
