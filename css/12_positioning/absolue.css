    ========
    1. Element is removed from the normal document flow, and is now relative to nearest parent
        element with an explicit position property(i.e non-static position value).
    
    2. If no parent has a position property other than default(static), then it is taken relative 
        to the root container.
    
    3. No space is left where it used to be !

    4. top, right, bottom, left and z-index can be used to scoot the element further.
