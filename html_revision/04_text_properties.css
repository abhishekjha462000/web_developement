/* 
    The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box.

    We can either give a number or percentage.

    When we give a number, the used value is the number provided multiplied by the element's font size.

    The MDN documentation says NOT to use percentages and unit-values for line-height.
